Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio","Abstract:  We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an
adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative
model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that
estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than
G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a
mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space
of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the
training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G
and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained
with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled
approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.
Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and
quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.","[Submitted on 10 Jun 2014]"

problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples
generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning
of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid
object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks
(StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text
descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems
through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive
shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding
Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text
descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with
photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and
add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of
the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we
introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages
smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and
comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic
images conditioned on text descriptions.","[Submitted on 10 Dec 2016 (v1), last revised 5 Aug 2017 (this version, v2)]"
"1666636307-3","https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004","Title:Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks","Authors:Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, Alexei A. Efros","Abstract:  We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution
to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the
mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to
train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach
to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations.
We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from
label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among
other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with
this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted
their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide
applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As
a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work
suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss
functions either.","[Submitted on 21 Nov 2016 (v1), last revised 26 Nov 2018 (this version, v3)]"

the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image
using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired
training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to
translate an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y in the
absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping G:X→Y
such that the distribution of images from G(X) is indistinguishable from the
distribution Y using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly
under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping F:Y→X
and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push F(G(X))≈X (and vice
versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired
training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object
transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative
comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our
approach.","[Submitted on 30 Mar 2017 (v1), last revised 24 Aug 2020 (this version, v7)]"
"1666636311-5","https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948","Title:A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks","Authors:Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Timo Aila","Abstract:  We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial
networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads
to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes
(e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation
in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive,
scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the
state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to
demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the
latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and
disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to
any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and
high-quality dataset of human faces.","[Submitted on 12 Dec 2018 (v1), last revised 29 Mar 2019 (this version, v3)]"
"1666636314-6","https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096","Title:Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis","Authors:Andrew Brock, Jeff Donahue, Karen Simonyan","Abstract:  Despite recent progress in generative image modeling, successfully generating
high-resolution, diverse samples from complex datasets such as ImageNet remains
an elusive goal. To this end, we train Generative Adversarial Networks at the
largest scale yet attempted, and study the instabilities specific to such
scale. We find that applying orthogonal regularization to the generator renders
it amenable to a simple ""truncation trick,"" allowing fine control over the
trade-off between sample fidelity and variety by reducing the variance of the
Generator's input. Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of
the art in class-conditional image synthesis. When trained on ImageNet at
128x128 resolution, our models (BigGANs) achieve an Inception Score (IS) of
166.5 and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 7.4, improving over the previous
best IS of 52.52 and FID of 18.6.","[Submitted on 28 Sep 2018 (v1), last revised 25 Feb 2019 (this version, v2)]"
"1666636316-7","https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196","Title:Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation","Authors:Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen","Abstract:  We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks.
The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively:
starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine
details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly
stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g.,
CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation
in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in
unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details
that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator
and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results,
both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we
construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.","[Submitted on 27 Oct 2017 (v1), last revised 26 Feb 2018 (this version, v3)]"

train generative models. In this work we introduce the conditional version of
generative adversarial nets, which can be constructed by simply feeding the
data, y, we wish to condition on to both the generator and discriminator. We
show that this model can generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels. We
also illustrate how this model could be used to learn a multi-modal model, and
provide preliminary examples of an application to image tagging in which we
demonstrate how this approach can generate descriptive tags which are not part
of training labels.","[Submitted on 6 Nov 2014]"

that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We focus
on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of
images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative
models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood
to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without
using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results
in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated
images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model
generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and
CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present
ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable
the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.","[Submitted on 10 Jun 2016]"
"1666636322-10","https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434","Title:Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks","Authors:Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala","Abstract:  In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (CNNs) has
seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised
learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help
bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and
unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional
generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural
constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised
learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that
our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations
from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator.
Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their
applicability as general image representations.","[Submitted on 19 Nov 2015 (v1), last revised 7 Jan 2016 (this version, v2)]"
