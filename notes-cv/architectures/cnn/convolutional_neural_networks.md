# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Pooling Layers
* The number of channels does not change before/after a pooling layer is applied. Pooling is done for each channel separately.
* Effects of Pooling Layers:
    * Reduce the size of the feature maps and hence reduce computations.
    * Introduce robustness (enforces local invariance).
