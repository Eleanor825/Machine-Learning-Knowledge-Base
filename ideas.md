* Apply extensive rotation as data augmentation to cats/dogs classification tasks.
* distribution of pooling layers in deep networks.
* In semantic segmentation, usually we first decrease spatial resolution and then increase it. What would happen if we first increase and then decrease (inverted bottleneck)? Would alternating decrease and increase work? More generally, what is the best distribution of spatial decrease/increase?
