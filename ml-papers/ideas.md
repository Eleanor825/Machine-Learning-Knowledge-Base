* Highway networks introduced a gating mechanism to regulate the flow of information along shortcut connections.
* Following these works, there have been further reformulations oof the connections between network layers [Dual Path Networks], [DenseNets], which show promising improvements to the learning and representational properties of deep networks.
* Grouped convolutions have proven to be a popular approach for increasing the cardinality of learned transformations [Deep Roots], [ResNeXt].
* More flexible compositions of operators can be achieved with multi-branch convolutions [Inception-v1], [Inception-v2], [Inception-v3], [Inception-v4], which can be viewed as a natural extension of the grouping operator.
* In prior work, cross channel correlations are typically mapped as new combinations of features, either independently of spatial structure [speeding up], [Xception] or jointly by using standard convolutional filters [Network in Network] with $1 \times 1$ convolutions.
